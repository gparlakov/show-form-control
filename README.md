# Show Form Control

See [ngx-show-form-control Readme.md here](./projects/show-form-control/README.md)

## Example app

The main application in this Angular project is an example app that uses show form control (also happens to use ngx-forms-typed).
`ngx-forms-typed` is NOT a dependency of the `show-form-control` just of the example app...

## Serve

`ng build show-form-control && ng serve` will run the app. `show-form-control` project needs to be built as it is referenced locally (see `tsconfig` `paths`).
